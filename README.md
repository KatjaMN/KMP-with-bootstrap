# KMP-with-bootstrap

KMP stands for Katja Maria Photography. Here I am presenting some of my photos in context of art.

The page is made as course work (Digital Technologies), assignment was to use Bootstrap carousel and jumbotron. I was concerned with accessibility issues of independently moving image content and wanted to give the user the possibility to control the movement.
